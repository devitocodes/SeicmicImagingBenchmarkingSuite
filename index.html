### Who is this for - seismic imaging community
* Energy companies.
* O&G service companies.
* Processor manufacturers, OEMs, supercomputer/cluster manufacturers.
* Cloud providers.
* Independent software vendors.
* Academic research community.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Vision

Bring *the community* together to:
* Standardize benchmarking of seismic imaging kernels.
* Provide open-source reference implementations for a range of architectures.
* Publish reproducible benchmark experiments.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Domain specific benchmarks
* Basis of purchasing decisions for on-prem and Cloud.
  * Market value of HPC market in O&G ~1b USD.
* Software roadmaps:
  * Performance-critical software must be written in vendor-native programming model.
  * Uniform developers are a scarce, expensive (and leaving industry).
  * Extensive code verification and code hardening.
* Enables collaboration with hardware and Cloud vendors.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
> Porting key benchmarks to a new architecture, including performance analysis and tuning, typically takes multiple months of *unicorn* developer effort. Cost estimates range from 500k-1m USD per customer-architecture pair.

###  \<rant\> Apples-to-~apples~mystry-fruit comparisons
Common issues benchmarking against other codes:
* Difference in the PDEs (e.g., different BCs, constant vs variable density).
* Difference in discretisation, e.g.,
  * Time-order, space-order, boundary conditions, (dx, dy, dz, dt), (nx, ny, nz, nt).
  * Have encountered ~10 different variations of TTI.
* ...
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* ...
* Difference in algorithimic optimizations, e.g., expanding box, factorization.
* Runtime choices, e.g.,
  * Pure OpenMP vs MPI-x, pinning.
* Are we even computing the same solution?
  * Floating point addition is non-associative.

### Objectives of standardisation
* Standardize problem specification, includes:
  * Correctness tests.
  * Performance metrics.
* Open-source reference implementation:
  * Design in reproducibility, e.g., containers to set runtime environemnet.
  * Starting point porting, optimizing in-codes.
  * Sandbox for vendors, customers and researchers to collaborate.

  ---

* Increase quality of benchmarks: Gradient-type benchmarks are uncommon dispite the fact that backpropagation is frequently the main performance bottleneck.
* In general, the benchmarks themselves are closed-source. This not only means significant duplication of effort but frequently leads to a lack of robust and reproducible results. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Challenges: Algorithmic development
  * Improved physics models (e.g., elastic models).
  * Improved numerical discretization of the forward model and its adjoint.
  * Novel algorithmic research, e.g., machine learning.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Challenges: Software development and optimization:
  * Ongoing optimization of software implementation on the current generation of CPUs/GPUs.
  * Optimization for different runtime environments for on-prem and Cloud environments. 
  * Porting to new architectures for evaluation and productionization.
  * Parallel programming models, e.g., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, HIP.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Scope of benchmarking
* Seismic imaging is dominated by the cost of forward modelling and the adjoint-state method.
  * Many different PDEs and choices of discretization.
* Variability in OI, memory pressure and register pressure.
* Important to choose benchmarks that reflect real use case, e.g.:
  * Gradient benchmarks should be done in addition to forward model benchmarks.
  * Large offsets or high frequency will necessitate distributed memory parallelization.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Out of scope
* Storage IO (with the exception is serialization for gradient computation).
* Full FWI/RTM - compute cost is too high.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Roadmap

Taking inspiration from numerous benchmarking suites from other disciplines, this
initiative aims to bring together expertise from industry and academia to:

* Standardize benchmarking of seismic imaging kernels.
* Publish reproducible benchmark data.
* Provide reference implementations and maximize software reuse.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase I: Bootstrap the creation of v0.1
Milestones:
* Announce call for participation and create initial stakeholder group - this presentation.
* Create template benchmark specifications - encodes best practise.
* Create examplar benchmark specifications based on isotropic acoustic and TTI.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase I: details
Considerations when defining a benchmark specification:
* Unambiguous problem specification:
  * Enable benchmark problems to be set up using different codes.
  * Problem dependencies, e.g., datasets will be open access.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* Define measures of success:
  * Correctness test, e.g., error norms.
  * Measure stencil throughput (grid-points-per-second).
  * Measure parallel efficiency.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
* Problem size:
  * Problem sizes should be representative of production workloads.
  * Reduced problem sizes or space-order may also be necessary:
    * Training, aid in code porting, evaluation on new architectures with low memory.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Submission process
* Benchmark specifications are submitted as PRs to the [GitHub repo]( 
https://github.com/devitocodes/SeicmicImagingBenchmarkingSuite).
* The file CONTRIBUTIONS.mb Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1.
* PRs will be peer reviewed and published on main after revisions have been completed.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase II
Milestones:
* Develop reference implementations of examplar benchmarks.
* Establish and demonistrate reproducibility standards.
* Initialize benchmark league table.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase II: details
Provide reference implementations of benchmark problems using the open-source
platform, [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/). 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Devito is a Python package
to implement optimized stencil computation (e.g., finite differences, image
processing, machine learning) from high-level symbolic problem definitions.
Devito builds on SymPy and employs automated code generation and just-in-time
compilation to execute optimized computational kernels using different parallel
programming models (e.g. MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC, CUDA) on different architectures
(e.g. Intel and AMD x86, NVidia and AMD GPUs, ARM).

### Submission process
* New submissions should be based on examplar templates.
* Submissions via as PRs to the GitHub repo.
* IP covered CONTRIBUTIONS.mb Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1.
* All PRs will be peer-reviewed after GitHub Actions checks have been completed.
* Published on main after revisions have been completed.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase III
Milestones:
* Governance structure.
* Define code and sustainability model.
* Open call for submissions.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Phase IV
Milestones:
* Bounties on improvements to existing benchmarks.
* Kaggle-inspired competitions to guide activity.
* Partner with publisher to create incentives for students and academics.
